<string name="msg_imagine_all_the">Imagine all the people you meet in your life. There are so many. They come in like waves, trickling in and out with the tide. Some waves are much bigger and make more of an impact than others. Sometimes the waves bring with them things from deep in the bottom of the sea and they leave those things tossed onto the shore. Imprints against the grains of sand that prove the waves had once been there, long after the tide recedes.</string>

<string name="msg_you_look_up_and">You look up and think, I wish I was up there.
But you\u2019re not.
Ugly love becomes you.
Consumes you.
Makes you hate it all.
Makes you realize that all the beautiful parts aren\u2019t even worth it. 
Without the beautiful, you\u2019ll never risk feeling this.
You\u2019ll never risk feeling the ugly.
So you give it up. You give it all up. 
You never want love again, no matter what kind it is,
because no type of love will ever be worth living through the ugly love again.</string>

Through the window
she saw rain drops
kissing the dusty rusty green leaves.
She was dancing in his arms
and grass dancing too.
Suddenly a drop made her 
hand little wet and
there was rain, leaves, grass,
window but
he was not there and 
she was all alone just
left with
Stained window with memories.</string>
