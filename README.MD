A place where people are able to post their own poetry/blogs. The app is an indirect way of expressing what you feel instead of penning it down, you can post your poems on this app. Poeticule usually means an insignificant poet, even if you’re not a re-known poet or author you can be a poet of your own. You can also take references from the poems that are uploaded in this app. This is just a viewable app, as we couldn’t integrate API and database due to limited time constraints. The app also has many errors.

Problem Statement - 
Good or Bad, the way of expression is important. Poeticule provides you a medium to express it in the form of poems or blogs.
